                        I want to express my thoughts on cars and maybe convince you, that they are cool.
                        Furthermore, I want to inform you about some special automobiles, which I really admire.

                        <p class="h2-description">WHY DO I ADMIRE CARS?</p>
                        <p class="article-content">The love to automobiles started when I was a little kid playing with
                            Hotwheels' toy cars. I used to play with them daily
                            and I even started to collect them. Until today I have not thrown them away, because they
                            remember me of a good childhood. One of my first toy cars
                            was the Nissan 370z, which I am a big fan of nowadays. One picture of the 370z is show in
                            the article 'My Taste In Cars Looks Like This'.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-content">Moreover, when I started the process of getting the driver's licence,
                            I truly enjoyed driving with the car of my mom.
                            It was a 1999 VW New Beetle 1.9TDI with 90hp. It certainly was not the power, which
                            fulfilled me with satisfaction, it was just the car itself.
                            With every look at that car, the connection between me and the car got stronger.
                            Unfortunately, months after I got my driver's licence, we had to sell the car.
                            And that was a little pain in my heart... you may not believe me.

                        </p>
                        <p class="article-content">
                            First, people tried to build cars, which run on steam. You can compare those cars with locomotives.
                             But soon they got confronted with the problem, that steam cars didn't suit in peoples' everyday life.
                              So the focuse changed and in 1885 the first true automobile was developed.
                        </p>    
                        <p class="article-content">
                            The first true automobile was developed by Karl Benz. The four wheels got powered from an engine using petrol or gasoline  
                            for combustion, which delivered the needed force. Nowaydays, gasoline cars have become insanely good in terms of performance.
                            
                            Beeing fast, comfortable and fun to drive, the car got the most important transport vehicle.
                             Even in economic fields the automobile has become irreplaceable.
