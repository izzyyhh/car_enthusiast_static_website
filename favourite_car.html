                    <h2>The Nissan Skyline</h2>
                    <p>The first Skyline, which was introduced in the year 1957 from the Prince Motor Company was rather
                        a modest luxury car than a sportscar. With the merger of the two
                        companies Nissan and Prince Motor Company in 1967, the car evolved to a performance car, as it
                        is known for it nowadays. From now on many desgins were implemented and
                        that is why the car's look changed from decade to decade. For more on <a

                        <p class="h2-description">THE WELL KNOWN R-MODELS</p>
                        <p class="article-content"> The most known Skylines are the later models with the trademark
                            round break and tail lights.
                            The following picture shows the R31-Model in the year 1986. The R31's concept was much
                            longer and wider than the previous Skylines.
                            The R32-, R33, R34's design are a further development of the R31's one. The R35 is the
                            newest model from the Skyline-series, which still has
                            the trademarks of the previous models but the basic concept is different.


                        </p>
                        <p class="article-content">The popularity of the Nissan Skyline has become huge. Movies and
                            video games in the automobile-scene implented the famous Skylines and that logically had and
                            still has positive
                            effects for the brand. For more on <a

                        <p class="h2-description">WOOW! WHAT A BEAUTY!
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-content">This beauty was first produced in the year 1998. There are several
                            designations of the R34 (same goes to other R-series), for instance: GT, GT-T, GT-R.
                            These specifications slightly differ in look but more in motorization. The GT-R has the
                            greatest performance.
                        </p>
                        <p class="article-content">
                            The R34 GT-R has the <a
                                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nissan_RB_engine#RB26DETT">RB26DETT engine</a>,
                            which is a twin-turbo
                            Inline-six engine manufactured by Nissan. It delivers 280hp and 392Nm. If you ask me, I
                            would say you dont need more.
                            But for those who like more power, they should go for the RB28 engine(493hp, 540Nm). All in
                            all, the RB26 as well as the RB28 are monsters. Because of the two turbos
                            simple modifications can lead to an insane increase in performance. That is what most owners
                            do. The R34 is not only a beast in performance but also a beauty in appearance.</p>

                <h2>Sadly, production was discontinued</h2>
                <p>In 2005 the last Nissan Skyline R34 GT-R left the production room. Now the younger brother R35 is
                    getting produced,
                    which also has good design and great performance. You can still buy a R34 though, but the price is
                    much higher than in 1998-2005.
